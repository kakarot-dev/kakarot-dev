## Axel (Joel)

I work on backend and systems-level software.  
Most of my projects are tools — things that run on a server, a machine, or in a pipeline.

I’m currently focused on Rust, backend architecture, and understanding how real systems behave under constraints (performance, reliability, simplicity).

---

### What I work on
- Rust-based CLI tools and backend services  
- Linux automation and system utilities  
- Low-level experiments (C++ / IoT / networking)

I’m less interested in frameworks and more interested in how things work underneath.

---

### Currently Working on
Currently architecting Aether, a self-hosted cloud platform using Rust & Firecracker. I enjoy bridging the gap between low-level systems (Linux/KVM) and high-level product engineering (TypeScript/React)
---

### Selected projects
- **Backpack**  
  An evolving Rust backend project where I experiment with service structure, file handling, and system trade-offs.

- **pdfpassremover**  
  A small Rust CLI that decrypts password-protected PDFs when the password is known. Built for batch document workflows.

- **cordx-upload**  
  A lightweight Linux automation tool in Rust for managing file uploads.

- **audio_transmitter**  
  A C++ prototype exploring audio transmission in constrained IoT environments.

---

### Direction
I’m deliberately keeping my project list small and focused.  
My goal is to grow into backend and systems roles, and eventually work closer to infrastructure and AI systems rather than application UI.
